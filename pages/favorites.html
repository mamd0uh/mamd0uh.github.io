<p>This is just a short-list of my favorite TV-Shows. I mainly like to watch light TV-Shows before sleeping, TV-shows that makes it easy for me to sleep without thinking about what was in the episode or thinking what's going to happen next. </p>

<p> Friends is a 90's Comedy TV show, based in Manhattan, about 6 friends who go through just about every life experience imaginable together; love, marriage, divorce, children, heartbreaks, fights, new jobs and job losses and all sorts of drama. </p>

<p> Gossip Girl, a ruthless and mysterious blogger reveals secrets about teens in upper east side New York. With roller coaster romances and piles of secrets hiding away for Gossip Girl to find, this show is sure to bring the upper east side and its drama into our lives. </p>

<p> You is a 2014 thriller novel written by New York Times bestselling author Caroline Kepnes. The story is narrated by Joe Goldberg, a bookstore employee who develops an obsession with an aspiring writer named Beck. The title, You, alludes to the narratorâ€™s obsession; the entire narrative is addressed to Beck in the second person. The novel and its sequels were adapted into a television series of the same name.
